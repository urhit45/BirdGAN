# BirdGAN
A generative adversarial network for creation of new bird images from existing Kaggle Dataset

# Dataset:
The dataset used for the implemenntation was the Kaggle's 225 Bird Species Dataset, of which I used only 1000 random images, for obvious computation reasons. As the name of the dataset suggests, it contains 225 Birds each of which has 150 images on an average.

# Motivation
The Motivation for this project was provided by moxiegushi, He has performed a similar implementation for Pokemons, which in my opinion is much cooler than birds.
